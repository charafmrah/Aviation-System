# Flight Planning System

The flight planning system will have information about different airports and the available routes between them. The routes will have information about the distance and the price of each flight. The users of this app would have an interface to select where they want to travel from and the destination. Then, the program will return the following paths: the shortest path and the cheapest path. This system will be implemented as an Android app using JAVA. The airports and the routes information will be stored using graphs. Then the shortest & cheapest paths will be generated using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and stored using linked lists. This is a project for the course SEN2212.
